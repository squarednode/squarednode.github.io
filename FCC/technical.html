                      Why you should use borders when building your website:
                    </h1>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    So using borders when building your website can help a lot.
                    You can visually see what is going on with each container
                    and item.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Borders also give you positive confirmation you are building
                    a responsive site. When you scale your site in the browser
                    you can see each item scale or stay fixed. Height of 100%
                    causing your footer to move at large sizes, put a border on
                    it and watch what happens and you can diagnose the fix.
                  </p>
                  <li>Borders help identify size</li>
                  <li>Borders help identify position</li>
                  <li>Borders help identify location</li>
                  <li>Borders help identify possible overlaps</li>
                  <li>Borders help identify margin issues</li>
                  <li>Borders help identify padding issues</li>
                  <li>Borders help identify global site issues</li>
                  <p>
                    With borders you are giving your self a valuable tool that
                    will give you a visual way to see your site as you build it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I plan to clean this up and put in a blog for later use.
                    Maybe type this up in word. Add some pictures and some
                    grpahs to show why borders can save time and money on
                    initial layouts. I highly recommend it as it saved me so
                    many headaches while building this site.
                  </p>

                    Why this <code>button</code> exists is a question to me.

                    This text is filler text. You are getting close to the
                    prize. When you put <code>backgroundcolor</code> and
                    <code>font-color</code> in the CSS file the webpage will go
                    well together.

                    Preview your website in chrome or other web browser and use
                    the right click to get the menu. The menu will have an
                    inspect item. Once you have clicked the inspect you can hide
                    and view specific properties of the page. This menu is
                    called Dev Tools and is very important to your development
                    of webpages.

                  <h5>One time I was an Engineer</h5>
                  <p>
                    My career prior was mechanical engineering and I did a white
                    paper on crack propigation. Sadly I am not able to find this
                    paper so you will not get the report on crack propergation.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Crack propigation happens when forces are exerted on
                    materials and causes the material to deform.
                  </li>
                  <li>This deformation is what we call cracks.</li>
                  <li>
                    Cracks can happen in one material or multiple materials if
                    bonded together.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The study was on crack propigation between fiberglass and
                    carbon fiber
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    The final outcome was that the carbon fiber will not
                    continue to crack if the fiberglass is cracking. This is
                    good news as we used carbon fiber as a frame with a
                    fiberglass thematic surface.
