                            A healing session is an energetic cleansing and renewal. During an in-person session, the client lays calmly on a massage table, and hands are placed near different parts of the body to infuse life force energy into the body as directed by Heaven. Relaxing music is played. During the session, you may experience a range of emotions, which is expected and is a sign that concealed issues are being brought to the surface for energetic release. The beneficial effects will likely continue for a few days after the session.
                            Please contact David to arrange a day and time for your healing session. Full payment is required in advance to confirm your appointment. David will send an invoice via email, or you can pay using the link below. Cancellations or rescheduling are permitted with more than 24 hours’ notice. When canceled with less than 24 hours notice and for "no shows," a nonrefundable fee of $50 will apply. Individual healing manifests over time in different ways for each person. Therefore, a particular outcome cannot be guaranteed and no refunds are given.

Healing over a distance is effective in the same manner as if the client were in-person. </p>
