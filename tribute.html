    <p id="tribute-info">Teeth from what is now documented as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874
        1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming
        1892, Edward Drinker Cope found two vertebral fragments of a large dinosaur.
        Barnum Brown, assistant curator of the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of T. rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900
        partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902, comprising approximately 34 fossilized bones
        Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the American Museum of Natural History, named the second skeleton T. rex in 1905
        1907, identified by Hatcher as those of a theropod rather than a ceratopsid
        Henry Fairfield Osborn recognized the similarity between Manospondylus gigas and T. rex as early as 1917
        1941, the T. rex type specimen was sold to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
        1960s, there was renewed interest in Tyrannosaurus, resulting in recovery of 42 skeletons (5â€“80% complete by bone count) from Western North America.
        967, Dr. William MacMannis located and recovered the skeleton named "MOR 008", which is 15% complete by bone count and has a reconstructed skull displayed at the Museum of the Rockies
        Sue Hendrickson, an amateur paleontologist, discovered the most complete (approximately 85%) and largest Tyrannosaurus skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation on August 12, 1990
        Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan (BHI 3033), in honor of amateur paleontologist Stan Sacrison, was recovered from the Hell Creek Formation in 1992. Stan is the second most complete skeleton found, with 199 bones recovered representing 70% of the total
        998, Bucky Derflinger noticed a T. rex toe exposed above ground, making Derflinger, who was 20 years old at the time, the youngest person to discover a Tyrannosaurus. The specimen, dubbed Bucky in honor of its discoverer, was a young adult, 3.0 metres (10 ft) tall and 11 metres (35 ft) long. Bucky is the first Tyrannosaurus to be found that preserved a furcula (wishbone). Bucky is permanently displayed at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis.
        2001, a 50% complete skeleton of a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History. Dubbed Jane (BMRP 2002.4.1), the find was thought to be the first known skeleton of a pygmy tyrannosaurid, Nanotyrannus, but subsequent research revealed that it is more likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus,
        2002, a skeleton named Wyrex, discovered by amateur collectors Dan Wells and Don Wyrick, had 114 bones and was 38% complete
        In 2006, Montana State University revealed that it possessed the largest Tyrannosaurus skull yet discovered
        This is the work of legends. The legend is the cute dino.
