        <h2 class=header-text></h1>About Me:</h1>

        <p class=body-text>As a youngster I loved drawing and math and excelled at mathematics
        through school. I was always involved with computers and digital means to
        communicate with others. I self-taught myself most of the programs I used back
        then and today. In school I got involved with woodworking, machining, and drafting
        which propelled me to some of the things I am involved in now. </p>
        
        <p class=body-text>Later in life, I started working at a custom car shop where
        I managed the office and developed the companyâ€™s webpages along with my own car
        clubs page. Preparing the perfect picture and making each page make an impact
        was my goal. Feeling that I needed more out of life and a new career though, I went
        to college and got a degree in Mechanical Engineering. </p>
        
        <p class=body-text>As an engineer I got a job with Universal Studios and worked
        in the theme park industry for 7 years. I worked with roller coasters, special
        effects, and show action equipment. In this career I worked with designers,
        creators, and other engineers to build world class attractions like Super Mario
        World. With the impact of Covid-19 on the industry, I wanted to get back into
        digital services that I could help other companies succeed. This is how Squared
        Node came about. </p>
