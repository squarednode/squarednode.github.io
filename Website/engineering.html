        <p class=body-text><b>Drafting</b> – Our drafting services include mechanical
        design for 2D and 3D projects. We use a combination of SolidWorks and AutoCAD
        depending on your needs.</p>
        
        <p class=body-text>We will create models based on your design. Each model will
        be created with individual parts that are ready for fabrication.</p>
        
        <p class=body-text>If requested, we will develop engineering sheets. All our
        drafting sheets come with a full BOM, dimensioning, revision history, and title
        block. Assembly and welding documents can be created as well if requested. </p>
        
        <p class=body-text><b>Documentation</b> – We specialize in Hazard Analysis ISO
        14971 and Risk Assessment ISO 9001 for your mechanical project. We provide full
        collaboration and documentation for your project as you progress through each
        phase.</p>
        
        <p class=body-text>Hazard analysis can be produced from a top-down approach or
        bottom-up depending on your project requirements. Failure modes and effects
        analysis (FMEA) can be developed as well depending on your project’s needs.</p>
        
        <p class=body-text><b>Calculations </b>– We can provide you with calculations
        for your project to verify it is meeting your needs. Our services include
        kinematic, dynamic, simple structural loading, HVAC, and fluids calculations.</p>
